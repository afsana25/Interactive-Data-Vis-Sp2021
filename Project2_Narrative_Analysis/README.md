# _Prospectus :_

The concept I have chosen in the Exploratory project, "How Women's Fertility and Employment Participation Rate are Shaping World Economic," is a broad subject.  The narrative project will be the focus on the same topic and will show more analysis.  The motivation of this project is to break down the Exploratory Project more and provide the possible answer to why women have a high fertility rate and why their participation is low in low-income regions compared to high-income areas.  The main focus would be the possible education rate and how safe the country is for women compared to high-income countries.   I will dive more and hopefully make a connection between those and provide a possible solution to this problem.  I am still working on collecting more data and working on the code.  I think the project will have a world choropleth map and bar charts for the visualizations.
