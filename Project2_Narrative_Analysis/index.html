        The analysis shows the socio-economic indicators such as Women Literacy Rate, Women Violence Rate, Teen Mother rate can affect their participation in Employment.
         For the bubble chart, only 146 countries have participated in the visualization due to many missing values for the country. The World bubble map shows larger the bubble size, and the more women face violence. The hover over the map shows the country name, violence rate, employment rate, and teen mother rate. It tells that the country with less violence towards women has more literacy rate, lower teen mother rate, which makes the country has more women employment rate. The correlation analysis shows the relationship with indicators. It has also shown that women with less education rate, more teen mother rate, and more violence towards women refrain from participating in Employment in a country. </p><br>

      <li><cite><b> Women Employment Rate:</b> </cite>It represents the average women employment participation rate of a country. If the rate is 10%, it means that only 10

        the job field among 100 women of that particular country.

      <li> <cite><b> Women Violence Rate:</b> </cite> It represents the average rate women face violence in the country. If the rate is 10%, it means that only 10

 </li>
      <li><cite> <b>Women Literacy Rate:</b> </cite> It represents the average literacy rate of the women of a country.

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The correlation analysis is to see the relationship between the indicators. The value ranges from -1 to 1. The negative value means if one indicator value is increasing, another indicator's value is decreasing. The positive value means if one indicator value increasing, another one is increasing. The value 0 means no relationship between variables. The value 1 means strongly correlated. Only 80 countries' values have been used in the correlation analysis because the indicator teen mother rate has many null values for the countries, but only 80 countries have values.  If we have more value, we can have a better answer. Still, the analysis proves what we want to prove. If we look carefully at the table, the Employment Rate negatively correlates with Teen Mother(-0.53 = negative moderate), Violence Rate(-0.29 =  negative small). It means more teen mother rate, and violence rate has negative impacts on the employment rate. The employment rate positively correlates with the women's literacy rate (0.79= relatively positive strong correlation). It means if the literacy rate of women is increasing, the employment rate of women is also growing.  If we see the violence rate, it positively correlates with teen mothers (0.19 = slight positive) and negatively correlates with the literacy rate(-0.31 = negative small). It means the number of teen mothers is increasing, they are more violent,  and if the literacy rate increases, the violence rate decreases.  The literacy rate is negatively correlating with the teen mother rate(0.52 = moderately strong). It means the more women are literate in a country have a fewer teen mother. The correlation analysis has done in R. The table has written in HTML. The table has given below:
