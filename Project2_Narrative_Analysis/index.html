            <h3>Overview of the Project:</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p> The Narrative project shows the socio-economic indicators such as Women Literacy Rate and Women Violence Rate can affect
                their participation in Employment in terms of regions in the world. The World choropleth map will be showing an average
                Education rate 2018(the most updated data) and violence rate in the country for 2019. The first bar charts demonstrate
                the female Literacy Rate, and the last bar chart shows the average female violence rate in terms of income group,
                sorting through the highest to lowest percentage. The previous project I have worked on, the Exploratory project, is
                "How Women's Fertility and Employment Participation Rate are Shaping World Economic." This narrative project breaks down
                more of the Exploratory Project. Its primary focus is to show the education rate and how safe the country is for women
                compared to low to high-income countries. The data have collected from <cite> <a
                            href="https://data.oecd.org/" target="_blank"> Visit Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.org!</a> </cite>. I have collected, cleaned, and combined data
                    <!--<a href="./data/Data_Final.csv">Actual Data!</a>-->. The data involves only 135 countries since
                    some
                    countries of have missing data, so I have deducted those from this project. For data visualization, I
                    have used D3 and JavaScript. The codes I have used from the <b><cite>Interactive Data
                            Visualization</cite></b>
                    class tutorial, and an online resource <cite> <a href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/"
                            target="_blank">Visit D3 Graph Gallery.com!</a> </cite>.
                    The data visualization shows that women with less education rate and more violence towards women refrain them to participate in employment
                in a country.

        <h4>What is GDP Per Capita?</h4>
        <p>
        <blockquote> According to <cite> <a
                    href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-capita-gdp.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Per%20capita%20gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP)%20is%20a%20metric%20that,a%20country%20by%20its%20population.&text=Small%2C%20rich%20countries%20and%20more,the%20highest%20per%20capita%20GDP."
                    target="_blank"> www.investopedia.com</a></cite>, the gross domestic product of a country is an
            economic indicator which is the value of all productions such as goods and
            services made in a country in a specific time. The GDP per capita has calculated by dividing the GDP of a
            country by its
            population. It defines a person's income in a country in a specific year. </blockquote>

        So it can be other reasons, or women are facing other issues. I hope I can break down and answer the question in
        the upcoming
        narrative project.

        <h4>The Reason of Chosing the Topic:</h4>
        <blockquote>First of all, I am a woman, and much research talks about women's empowerment. However, in some
            regions or countries,
            women do not get enough equality as men. They do not get enough education and a safe place to work. Since I
            belong to
            South Asia and currently living in the USA, and I can see the difference, I choose this topic to analyze.
            Since I want to be a
            data analyst in socio-economy development, people who do the socio-economic analysis are good for
            understanding the data
            and visualization. I think most people will easily familiar with this data visualization.</blockquote>
