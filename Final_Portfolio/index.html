                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Before joining the interactive data visualization course, I hardly know HTML, CSS, or javascript. I have zero knowledge about VS code and d3. Attending the class and professor shows the demo of bar charts, time series, scatter plots,  geographic design, or other visuals giving me a good foundation for understanding and creating visuals. Working with VS code is the easiest thing to do for this class, and having the live server to show immediate visualization is fantastic. The best thing about working with the live server is I can easily find my errors rather than going over the actual GitHub link to show the work. I also enjoy working with d3, in which I was able to learn different types of visualization. One of the hardest things I have faced is geographic visualization, hovering over the map, and calling the information from the indicators. Getting conscious help from the professor helps me to finish the projects. The other most challenging part I have met was searching for appropriate data for the projects. Since some of the data are very messy, and I have to clean up a lot. For most of the data wrangling part, I used SQL, and newly I have started to use observable to the manipulation. Observable is much easier for the wrangling and working with visualizations quickly.  

                    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Since I want to be a socio-economic development analyst, I like to works with social issues of different areas, so I decided to choose the topic of women's contribution to their economy even though I don't know where to start. 
                        Working with the Ideation, brainstorming workshops improves my thinking ability to approach the analytic skills towards the projects. In the prospectus part, I provided how I will be the project analytical approach. 
                        However, I have many changes in the final step than what I decide to show in the prospectus. I have chosen some different visualization from the tutorial for the projects. Since I have understood the tutorials and like the scatter plots  
                        
            and time series, I want to do a bubble chart and time series for one of the projects. First, to reduce the difficulties, I go over the tutorial videos and research the topic to understand appropriate indicators for the projects. The online resources about d3 or watching youtube improve my visuals activities quite often.
            I believe where the problem is, there are the solution exits. 
           Since I have mentioned that one of the challenges is to do geographic visualize,
           
           I am very eager to learn. I decide to use it for one of the projects even though I don't know which project I will use.
                        </p>
            </div>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before working on the exploratory, a lot of visualizations approached were coming into my head. As I mention before, I want to work with bubble charts, time series, or geographic visuals. Still, 
                other visualization thoughts such as scatter plots or choropleth visuals also come to my mind. I decided to show bubble charts or time-series with dropdowns for the exploratory project, but I have ended up having the bubble chart and the bar charts only. I pick the bubble chart because it is better to represent population size since I need to show how women's fertility rate can impact its population and per capita income. I thought that time series would show the GDP of the countries for years. In the ideation workshop, one of the workÂ·mate advice to show the bar charts to provide the country's employment rate in specific regions or income groups. I think it will be good to use the bar charts to demonstrate the employment rate of groups. 
                In the critic session, I got advice on a few improvements in the charts for the size of the bubble and showing the population proportion's visuals in terms of bubble size to enhance the beauty of the charts. 
                I think their advice was very constructive. I was not able to show the time series and show population in millions since I was running out of time.
            </p>
                    
              <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When I started to dive more into the project, some questions were rounding through my head, like why women's employment is low in low-income areas. The first question that comes to mind is what is the women population in those regions. I decided to compare its average population to the average of the men's population of the same income groups to determine whether its population is lower than the men population. To answer this question, I have used a grouped bar chart to visualize that the women and men populations are almost similar. In some cases, the women populations are more than men. This approach makes me connects to the narrative project. I think I can answer why women are less participating in employment in this project whether women's literacy rate is low or they are facing violence that refrains from them participating in the job. I have collected violence women and female literacy rate data, but many of them have missing values. First, I have decided to have a choropleth map of the world showing the violence rate highest to lowest and hover over the map to show the countries' literacy rate and tell that countries with less literate countries have more violence towards the women. Then I used bar charts to show the average literacy rate of the women in terms of region and income group. In the critic session, other colleagues advise me that it will be better to add some other reasons for less employment of women participation if females get married early or become mothers in teenage. They also advise me to show the employment rate that I didn't include in the narrative project and some improvements in the charts and show the relationship like the correlation between indicators. They also advise me to have a scatter plot. I think that the critic session is good for the improvements of both projects. Unfortunately, I could not do the correlogram in d3, which I have tried to do so, but able to show in a table in HTML format. If I have that visualization, it can give a better understanding of the project. I was unable to do the scatterplot since I was running times.</p>
                   <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If I have more time, I would have time-series and show the population proportion in the exploratory projects or visualize the correlogram and scatter plots in the narrative projects, enhancing the projects' beauty and would help the audiences to understand the concept more. At last, I can say I have learned a lot from the projects, such as thinking about many analytic approaches, research skills, or applying new methods to visuals. As the name implies of the course, Interactive Data visualization is really interactive. So far, the course is beneficial for my data analyst career.</p>

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <P>The project demonstrates that women with less fertility rate and more women's employment participation positively impact its GDP per capita. 
                    The visualizations have presented in a bubble chart and some series of bar charts According to the country's regions such as North America,
                     East Asia & Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, Europe & Central and South Asia, and income groups such as high-income, 
                     upper middle income, middle-income, and low-income groups. 
                    They show that high-income countries have more female employment participation rate compared to low-income countries.

                        <p>The project shows that countries with more literacy rate and violence towards women have  more employment participation rates of women. T
                            he visualization has demonstrated in a geographic map of the world having the bubbles low to high violence rate.  Some bar charts show that 
                            high-income countries have more literacy rate and less violence towards low-income countries. A correlation table shows the relationship 
                            between the employment to literacy rate and violence rate or other variables. A deployed link for this work has provided below:
