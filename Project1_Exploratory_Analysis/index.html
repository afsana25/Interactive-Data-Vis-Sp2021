            <h3>Overview of the Project:</h3>
            <blockquote>
            <p>The exploratory project shows the socio-economic indicators such as women's fertility rate, female employment
            participation rates, and female over male employment ratio can affect the economic conditions in terms of regions in the
            world. The bubble chart shows an average women fertility rate in the country, the country's population, and GDP (Gross
            Domestic Product) Per capita in bubble chart with showing in different colors in terms of region, like North America,
            East Asia & Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, Europe & Central Asia, and South Asia. The bar charts demonstrate female employment rates and females over
            male employment ratios in the region, sorting through the lowest to highest percentage. The data have collected from <cite> <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx" target="_blank"> Visit World
             Bank.Org!</a> </cite>. I have collected, cleaned, and combined data<!--<a href="./data/Data_Final.csv">Actual Data!</a>-->. For data visualization, I have used D3, and JavaScript.

<blockquote><p> <h4>What is GDP Per Capita?</h4>
<p> <blockquote> According to <cite> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-capita-gdp.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Per%20capita%20gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP)%20is%20a%20metric%20that,a%20country%20by%20its%20population.&text=Small%2C%20rich%20countries%20and%20more,the%20highest%20per%20capita%20GDP." target="_blank"> www.investopedia.com</a></cite>, the gross domestic product of a country is an economic indicator which is the value of all productions such as goods and
services made in a country in a specific time. The GDP per capita has calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its
population. It defines a person's income in a country in a specific year. </blockquote>  </p>
