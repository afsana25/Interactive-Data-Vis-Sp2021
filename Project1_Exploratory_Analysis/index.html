            <h3>Overview of the Project:</h3>
            <blockquote>
            <p>The exploratory project shows the socio-economic indicators such as women's fertility rate, and female employment
            participation rates can affect the economic conditions in terms of regions in the
            world. The bubble chart shows an average women fertility rate in the country, the country's population, GDP (Gross
            Domestic Product) per capita for 2019, and the income group in bubble chart with showing in different colors in terms of
            region, like North America, East Asia & Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, Europe & Central
            Asia, and South Asia. The first two bar charts demonstrate female employment rates in terms of income group and region.
            The last bar chart shows the average female and male population in terms of income group, and sorting through the
            highest to lowest percentage. The data have collected from <cite> <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx" target="_blank"> Visit World
             Bank.Org!</a> </cite>. I have collected, cleaned, and combined data<!--<a href="./data/Data_Final.csv">Actual Data!</a>-->. 
             For data visualization, I have used D3, and JavaScript. 
            The data visualization shows that women with less fertility rate and more women employment participation in a country
           has higher the GDP per capita.

<p> <h4>What is GDP Per Capita?</h4>
<p> <blockquote> According to <cite> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-capita-gdp.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Per%20capita%20gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP)%20is%20a%20metric%20that,a%20country%20by%20its%20population.&text=Small%2C%20rich%20countries%20and%20more,the%20highest%20per%20capita%20GDP." target="_blank"> www.investopedia.com</a></cite>, the gross domestic product of a country is an economic indicator which is the value of all productions such as goods and
services made in a country in a specific time. The GDP per capita has calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its
population. It defines a person's income in a country in a specific year. </blockquote>  </p>

   <blockquote><h4>Bubble Chart:</h4> </blockquote>

    <p><div id="d3-container"> </div></p>

    <blockquote>
    In the bubble chart, the X-axis represents the per capita income in 2019 of a country, and the Y-axis represents the
    fertility rate per woman in 2019. The population of a country represents in the radius of the points. The bigger the
    size of the radius of the point, the population is bigger. We can easily see that countries with more fertility rates tend to be less GDP Per Capita.

    <h4> Bar Charts:</h4>
    <p>In the first bart chart, the X-axis represents certain countries' regions in the bar charts, and the Y-axis represented the women's participation
    rates in those Regions in 2019. We can easily see North America's women have more participation rate than other regions.</p>

    <div id="barchart1"></div>

    <blockquote>
            <p>The below graph shows Female Employment participant rate  in terms of IncomeGroup. We can easily see that high income group has more female
                participation rates comapared to other groups.
            </p>
    </blockquote>
    <div id="barchart2"></div>

    <blockquote>
        <p> It makes me think that women's participation is less in the low-income group comapared to other groups, so to make sure I have provided the
        average female and male population in the project, it tells the population of both males and females equal to each
        other. In some cases, the female population is more than the male.</p>

    So it can be other reasons, or women are facing other issues. I hope I can break down and answer the question in the upcoming
    narrative project.

    </p>

    <p><h4>The Reason of Chosing the Topic:</h4> 
    <blockquote>First of all, I am a woman, and much research talks about women's empowerment. However, in some regions or countries,
    women do not get enough equality as men. They do not get enough education and a safe place to work. Since I belong to
    South Asia and currently living in the USA, and I can see the difference, I choose this topic to analyze. Since I want a
    data analyst in socio-economy development, people who do the socio-economy analysis are good for understanding the data
    and visualization. I think most people will easily familiar with this data visualization.</blockquote></p>
