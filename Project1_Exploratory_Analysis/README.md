\bf{The prospectus and Initial Scatch:}

The exploratory project’s motivation is to conduct the world’s socio-economic gaps between countries using the indicators such as their GDP, demographics data from the Kaggle website. The main concept I want to work with how the socio-economic indicators such as population, women fertility rate, or many more are affecting their economic status. Since I want a data analyst in socio-economy development, people who do the socio-economy analysis are good for them and can easily understand the data. I think most people will easily familiar with this data visualization. I am still working on collecting more information to give better knowledge and understanding for the project. So far, the project will look like a bubble chart with the dropdown menu
